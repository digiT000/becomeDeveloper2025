# 🧠 Dev Journey Archive

Welcome to my **developer progress tracker** — an old but meaningful repository where I documented and experimented with various projects, technologies, and coding practices throughout my early journey as a developer.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is a collection of code snippets, side projects, and learning experiments I created as I was building my skills and confidence in software development. It reflects:

- ✍️ Learning new programming concepts
- 📦 Building small features and utilities for practice
- 🧪 Experimenting with tools and development environments
- 📦 Mostly website challenge from frontendmentor.io

Although some parts may feel rough or outdated, they show the raw, unfiltered learning process that helped shape the way I code today.
